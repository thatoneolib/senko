# Senko

Senko is an entertainment bot for Discord themed around Sewayaki Kitsune no
Senko-san, written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) using the
[discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) library.

This repository contains the source code for the **rewrite** of Senko, meaning
that the code you find here is not the one used to run the bot. The goal is for
that to eventually be the case however.

# Development

Senko is a hobby project since her development began sometime in 2018. Since
early 2020 this rewrite has been planned and is now finally in development.

If you are curious about the ongoing development, you can join the development
channels in the support server, or check out the
[Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/v2gBsOfa/senko).

## Contributions

I appreciate people wanting to help, but unless it is bug fixes that are
properly documented, it is unlikely that I will merge the pull request. For
feature requests and feedback, please consider joining the support server
instead.

# Join the Community

Senko has an [Official Discord Server](https://discord.gg/ymrhJmc) that acts as
a support server for the bot. If you have questions, suggestions, want to give
feedback on the bot or report a bug, this is the place to make your voice heard.

# License

Senko is released under the [MIT License](LICENSE). 

# Hosting Senko

I would prefer if you do not run an instance of Senko. Instead, please consider
inviting the bot I am hosting through either the ``invite`` command, or using
[this link](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=460047216246128650&scope=bot&permissions=3468352).

If you still want to host your own instance of Senko, please refer to the
installation guide in the documentation.

# Attributions

Senko is named after the main character of "Sewayaki Kitsune no Senko-san", a
manga and anime by Rimukoro. 

The banner and avatar of the project use parts of the original cover art of the
first volume of the manga. 

All of the rights to the original character belong to their respective owners.
