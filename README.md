# Senko

Senko is an entertainment bot for Discord themed around Sewayaki Kitsune no
Senko-san, written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) using the
[discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) library.

This repository contains the source code for the **rewrite** of Senko, meaning
that the code you find here is not the one used to run the bot. The goal is for
that to eventually be the case however.

# Development

Senko is a hobby project since her development began sometime in 2018. Since
early 2020 this rewrite has been planned and is now finally in development.

## Contributions

Regarding contributions, I appreciate people wanting to help, but unless it is
explicitly bug fixes with good documentation, it is unlikely that I will merge
the pull requests.

For feature request and feedback, please join the support server.

# Join the Community

Senko has an [Official Discord Server](https://discord.gg/ymrhJmc) that acts as
a support server for the bot. If you have questions, suggestions, want to give
feedback on the bot or report a bug, this is the place to make your voice heard.

# License

Senko is released under the [MIT License](LICENSE). 

In addition, please mind the following restrictions regarding self-hosting:

* You may not use the name of Senko or the logo of the project in derivate bots.
* You may not host a public version of Senko.

This means that while you can create your own derivate of Senko (provided you
give proper attribution), or host a private instance of her, you can not
create an identical clone.

These restrictions exist for a couple of reasons. First, Discord has stated that
they would like for verified bots, if their code is public, to restrict the
creation of bots that could be seen as clones. 

Second, the intent behind making Senko's code public is to allow other people to
learn from it, not promote the creation of copy and paste clones.

# Attributions

Senko is named after the main character of "Sewayaki Kitsune no Senko-san", a
manga and anime by Rimukoro. 

The banner and avatar of the project use parts of the original cover art of the
first volume of the manga. 

All of the rights to the original character belong to their respective owners.
