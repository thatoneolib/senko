Concept
#######

Welcome to the concept section. This part of the documentation concerns itself
with the features and the assets of project.

You can find an overview of the planned and implemented features for Senko here,
complete with links to the relevant parts of the API reference and notes on the
design choices behind them. Further, the various assets used by Senko are also
documented here.

.. note::

    Please note that this should generally be considered work in progress until
    a feature is actually completed. Until that point, planned features may
    greatly change or be scrapped entirely.
